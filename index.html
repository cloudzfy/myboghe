<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This project is designed for Teaching Experiments on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) User Equipment (UE). It is based on an open source project Doubango Boghe, for creating a simplified software process of design and implementation, which can be better handled by students and beginners.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-background" class="anchor" href="#the-background"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Background</h3>

<p>Nowadays, since IMS plays an important role in worldwide telecommunication network, more and more professionals are required, which leads to the requirement of courses for graduate and undergraduate students. However, few projects can be found to instruct student training on IMS technology. This project is mainly designed in response to this requirement.</p>

<h3>
<a name="design--technology" class="anchor" href="#design--technology"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design &amp; Technology</h3>

<p>This project contains multiple parts of network elements (IMS UE, IMS AS, IMS Core, etc.). In this repository, we focus on PC-based IMS UE to describe the details of design and implementation.</p>

<p>The Teaching Cases contains Three different parts, each part is relative to others and instruct students to learn the sophisticated details step by step.</p>

<ul>
<li>Design a Half-duplex Chatroom client run in Windows Console</li>
<li>Design a Full-duplex Chatroom client run in Windows GUI</li>
<li>Implement Presence Service, including PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, etc.</li>
</ul><p>All the teaching experiments are based on Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. Students who are assigned in PC Client Group can finish the experiments by corperating with the members of other groups for system test.</p>

<h3>
<a name="vision" class="anchor" href="#vision"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vision</h3>

<p>This project not only provides an opportunity for students to understand the mechanism of IMS Technology in a natural way, but also assists students to focus on the main structure of IMS by hiding the sophisticated technical details in commercial model of IMS network.</p>
